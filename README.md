Write a program to output the following patterns given the number of rows:


Pattern #1 

1 

4 9 

16 25 36 

49 64 81 100 

121 144 169 196 225 

and so on. 


Pattern #2 

1 

3 2 

6 5 4 

10 9 8 7 

15 14 13 12 11 

and so on. 

Pattern #3 

A B 

C D E F 

G H I J K L 

M N O P Q R S T 

U V W X Y Z A B C D 

and so on. 


Pattern #4 

\#\#\# 

\#\#\#\# 

\#\#\#\#\# 

\#\#\#\#\#\# 

\#\#\#\#\# 

\#\#\#\# 

\#\#\# 


Pattern #5 

\#\#\#\#\#\# 

\#\#\#\#\# 

\#\#\#\# 

\#\#\# 

\#\#\#\# 

\#\#\#\#\# 

\#\#\#\#\#\# 

As a second challenge, create a program to output the patterns in reverse (from bottom row to top).
